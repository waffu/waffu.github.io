If you have experience writing any kind of code-related project, whether that be a small snippet or a full fledged production ready repository, it's universal that you will encounter some sort of problem that you're simply too lazy to scour every corner of the documentation for. In comes our lovely friend the search engine.


> after attempting to self teach .. it started to make sense

Stack Overflow is the universal goto after seeing the results, but occasionally you'll see personal blogs, and most of the time they'll answer your problem in a lot more detail than Stack Overflow. Bonus points for sometimes being the only resource for niche problems. If you click around them, they might host their resume on the site too, or an about page with some contact details, or maybe even host a picture of themselves. What's the reason for writing and maintaining a blog like this? I was curious the first couple of times I saw them, but now after attempting to self teach a couple of fairly complex libraries or concepts, it started to make sense.

1. `Learning concepts`
2. `A collection of past notes`
3. `Online presence`

Not all of these reasons may resonate with you and it's not an exhaustive list, but chances are you will find huge benefit in at least one of the described reasons that lead you to start writing.

# Learning concepts

The protégé effect is the idea that learning is faciliated better by teaching the concepts to other people. Teaching has been known to be one of the most effective learning tools for hundreds of years having numerous studies showing the effects of teaching as a learning tool. Though most references to the protégé effect relate to a teacher and learner in the same room, of which we aren't talking about, we are talking about a blog, there are still many correlations to the protégé effect.

Writing an explanation in your blog post is taking the teacher role for a resource, putting the protégé effect into... effect. During this, you're **constantly** learning through studying outside sources and revising your text for the whole time you are writing, additionally you should be making sure every piece of data is correct. This is important as having incorrect data isn't exactly great for private writings, but when you're writing for some arbitary person it can be pretty bad and *will* impact how people will see you, and your posts.

# A collection of past notes

The most prevalent reason for me personally is to keep a robust collection of notes, due to the frequency I find of me going back to old links/resources to get the same information time and time again. Why shouldn't you just keep using the same resources then? The problem is format and wording. Everyone has their own different way to mental model information presented to them. Format and wording can heavily impact how easy it is to compile your mental model, which ultimately makes processing the information that much harder.

> your blog post could also be the resource that makes it *"click"* for someone else

By presenting the information in your blog posts in your personal style, it can make it extremely easy to go back and digest the information to fix your mental model or if you have forgot some vital information. Who knows, your blog post could also be the resource that makes it *"click"* for someone else struggling with a concept.

# Online presence

Humans are social animals, that means you directly benefit from an online presence especially in the world of tech. Having a blog increases said presence as it's another vector of developing a reputation or way of even finding out that you exist in the first place. This will give you opportunities. Whether it's a potential employer using your blog as proof of knowledge, or a potential connection due to them finding your blog as an answer to a problem they may have, every person that finds their way to you through your increased presence, presents opportunity.

Knowing all this, make sure to associate your blog with your personal brand everywhere you can, your resume, your GitHub, etc. Your blog is an extension of you. Make the content relatable, easily consumable and correct and this will reflect on you. There is a whole industry based on how people perceive companies. While a single person isn't to the scale of a company, it's easy to see how perception matters in the current day and how you can use your blog as just another tool to affect it.
